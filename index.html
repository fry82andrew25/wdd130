				<h1>Andrew Fry | WDD 130</h1>
				<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Andrew Fry" width="200">
				<p>Hello! My name is Andrew Fry and I currently live in Houston, Texas, USA, but I am orignally from the PNW, primarily Oregon. I enjoy the outdoors, my family, and overall learning.
					I have difficulty sometimes with time-management, but am trying to get better at it. I enjoy outdoor activities, such as fly fishing, rock climbing, backpacking, mountaineering, etc.
					I really enjoy spending time with my family and seeing my kids grow to make wise choices, as I know this will bring them happiness and joy. I served a missiong in the Tampico, Mexico Mission.
					I fell in love with the people, culture, and language while on my mission. I am fluent in Spanish and love to use it as frequently as I can.
					Currently I work as a Senior Operations Analyst at a firm and am really enjoying my time there. It has been a huge blessing!
					I am currently taking courses surrounding software development as that is what I work in. I work with SQL, databases, python, VBA, and other languages.
					However, I have always found HTML to be difficult because it is more of a creative language, than an analytical language. I am not a very creative person in regards to web pages, so this is really going to test my abilities.
					I am looking forward to it!
